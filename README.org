#+TITLE: Lisp Notes

This repository is the house of all of my notes on Lisp. This repository will
predominately be about Common Lisp, but I may include some notes for other Lisp
dialects as I learn various things.

Everything is an expression

* Syntax
  While most languages use [[https://notes.ethancpost.com/infix_notation.html][infix notation]], lisp uses [[https://notes.ethancpost.com/prefix_notation.html][prefix notation]]. This means
  that while in most languages you might write something like this:
  #+begin_src js
    1 + 2 + 3;
    myfunction(x, y, z);
  #+end_src

  In Lisp you would write something like:
  #+begin_src lisp
    (+ 1 2 3)
    (myfunction x y z)
  #+end_src

  The first thing you may notice when looking at this is we only had to call the
  ~+~ operator once in the lisp example. That is because lisp is a
